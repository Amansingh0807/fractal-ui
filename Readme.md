## **🎯 Advantages of Using Fractal**

Fractal offers **versatility** and **seamless integration** that many other component tools do not provide:
- You’re free to use any template language or organizational structure you prefer.
- Components are integrated within your **active project**, ensuring they remain current with your build processes.
- **Data-driven previews** allow you to test components in real-world situations.

## **🚀 Key Features**

- **Reusable Component Libraries:** Develop libraries of components that can be reused throughout your user interface.
- **Modular Architecture:** Combine components freely to create anything from simple widgets to full pages.
- **Documentation & Preview:** Isolate and document components, ensuring they are thoroughly documented for future use.
- **Adaptable:** Works with any templating language, build tool, or organizational structure you choose.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily incorporate components into your build process or live website as dependencies.
- **Dynamic & Data-Driven:** Components can utilize either hardcoded or dynamic data (e.g., from HTTP APIs or Faker).
- **Customizable Interface:** Explore your component library via a web interface with themes that you can modify or create from scratch.
